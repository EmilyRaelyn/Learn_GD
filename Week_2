Welcome to Week_2 With Emily.Raelyn*
* The lawyers want me to make a disclaimer that I am NOT a professional or claiming to be one and I am not making money by you using this schedule. I am merely an enthusiast for game development and I am finally pursuing a dream that I had as a youngling of becoming a self-taught game developer on a BUDGET! And if you are anything like me, you are as well. Also this is CC BY NC SA- Meaning you may copy/publish/modify and adapt these documents but you aren't allowed to resell for commercial use or change the copyright license. THANK YOU!
** NOTE: This schedule is for those who want a moderate 2 week per month at LEAST 6-10 hours per week. If you want to go extreme like me, do it week by week instead of month by month. However, for those who need very light hobbyist schedule since they have other obligations feel free to adjust this as needed for YOUR needs. This is merely a template. 

This is a free resource that you can use that is helping me learn game development! I'd love to hear about your progress or your questions in my communities, feel free to reach out below:
